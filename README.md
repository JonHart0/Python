Example Python scripts:

## min_coins.py: [Idea From](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWW-jA6YjHk)
  A function that returns the number of Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, and Pennies that should be given to the customer after a purchase. Input expected to range from 1 : 99 cents, but will take sufficiently high amounts depending on the amount of coins available in the registar array. Dollars are NOT taken into account, and only change will be returned
  ```
  Examples: min_coins(33) --> 1 Quarters, 0 Dimes, 1 Nickels, 3 Pennies
            min_coins(999) --> 39 Quarters, 2 Dimes, 0 Nickels, 4 Pennies
  ```
min_coins_short is an updated version, that uses a for loop to reduce amount of code lines to 25%
